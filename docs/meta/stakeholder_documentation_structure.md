# Stakeholder-Focused Documentation Restructure Plan

## Identified Stakeholders

Based on the existing documentation analysis, I've identified the following primary stakeholders with distinct documentation needs:

### Primary Stakeholders

1. **End Users** - Community members who use the platform
   - Need user-friendly guides and feature documentation
   - Focus on safety tools, privacy controls, and social features
   - Examples: How to join communities, block users, report content

2. **Community Organizers** - Elected community leaders
   - Need community management and moderation tools documentation
   - Focus on member management, community settings, local moderation
   - Examples: Managing memberships, community moderation, engagement tools

3. **Platform Organizers** - Elected platform staff/administrators
   - Need comprehensive platform management documentation  
   - Focus on system-wide oversight, policy enforcement, analytics
   - Examples: Platform configuration, user management, compliance reporting

4. **Developers** - Technical team building and maintaining the platform
   - Need technical documentation, architecture guides, development processes
   - Focus on implementation details, API documentation, testing standards
   - Examples: System architecture, coding standards, deployment procedures

5. **Support Staff** - Team helping users with platform issues
   - Need troubleshooting guides, user assistance documentation
   - Focus on common issues, escalation procedures, user guidance
   - Examples: User onboarding help, troubleshooting guides, FAQ management

### Secondary Stakeholders

6. **Content Moderators** - Community volunteers for platform safety
   - Need moderation tools and safety procedure documentation
   - Focus on report review, content management, safety tools
   - Examples: Report processing, content removal, user safety tools

7. **Legal/Compliance** - Team ensuring regulatory compliance
   - Need policy documentation, audit trails, compliance procedures
   - Focus on data protection, regulatory compliance, audit capabilities
   - Examples: Privacy policies, data retention, compliance reporting

## Key Features of New Structure

### 1. **Stakeholder-Centric Organization**
- Each primary stakeholder gets their own directory with relevant documentation
- Documentation written specifically for each audience's knowledge level and needs
- Clear entry points for each stakeholder type

### 2. **Shared Documentation with Symlinks**
- Documents relevant to multiple stakeholders placed in `/shared/`
- Relative symbolic links used in stakeholder directories to avoid duplication
- Single source of truth for cross-cutting concerns

### 3. **Audience-Appropriate Content**
- **End Users**: Simple, task-oriented guides with screenshots and examples
- **Community Organizers**: Management-focused with community governance emphasis
- **Platform Organizers**: Comprehensive oversight tools and analytics
- **Developers**: Technical deep-dives with code examples and architecture
- **Support Staff**: Troubleshooting focus with escalation procedures
- **Content Moderators**: Safety-focused with clear procedures and guidelines
- **Legal/Compliance**: Policy and regulatory compliance focus

### 4. **Clear Navigation Structure**
- Main README.md provides stakeholder-specific entry points
- Table of contents provides comprehensive overview
- Each directory has its own README.md for navigation
- Logical grouping within each stakeholder section

### 5. **Specialized Sections**
- **Implementation**: Project management and planning materials
- **Diagrams**: All visual documentation with proper maintenance procedures  
- **Meta**: Documentation system management and quality standards

## Implementation Benefits

### For Stakeholders
- **Faster content discovery** - go directly to relevant section
- **Appropriate depth** - content written for their expertise level
- **Task-focused organization** - grouped by what they need to accomplish
- **Reduced cognitive overhead** - no need to parse irrelevant technical details

### For Maintainers
- **Clear ownership** - obvious where new content belongs
- **Reduced duplication** - shared content managed centrally with symlinks
- **Scalable structure** - can accommodate growth in any stakeholder area
- **Quality standards** - consistent approach within each audience type

This structure acknowledges that different stakeholders have fundamentally different information needs, understanding levels, and use cases for the documentation.
