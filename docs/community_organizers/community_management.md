# Community Management

This section describes how to manage communities, partners, invitations, memberships, and conversations.

## People

- **Create & Edit**: Add or modify person profiles, including name, email, profile image, and bio.
- **Search & Filter**: Locate individuals by name, email, community membership, or role.
- **Bulk Actions**: Import, export, or deactivate multiple person records via CSV operations.

## Communities

- **Host Community**: Register, customize, and activate new communities with unique branding, privacy, and membership settings.

- **Future Expansions**:
  - **Personal Communities**: Allow individuals to create their own private community spaces.
  - **Geospatial Communities**: Auto-generate communities based on geographic boundaries (regions, cities).
  - **Language Communities**: Segment communities by preferred language/localization.
  - **Nested Sub-Communities**: Enable hierarchical community structures (chapters, subgroups) under a parent community.

## Partners

- **Name & Description**: Set partner name, subtitle, and summary description for public listings.
- **Images**: Upload and manage partner logo, cover image, and photo galleries.
- **Contact Details**: Store multiple addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and social links via the contact detail editor.
- **Mapping & Locations**: Geolocate partners on maps, define service areas, and display interactive location markers.

## Invitations

- **Platform Invitations**: Send email invites to new users, assign default roles, and monitor acceptance rates.
- **Guest Access**: Create time-limited guest tokens for one-click entry without account creation.
- **Invitation Lifecycle**: Track invitation statuses (pending, accepted, expired), resend or revoke invites, and view audit logs.

## Memberships

- **Role Assignment**: Grant or revoke platform/community roles for individuals, controlling their access and capabilities.
- **Join & Leave**: Manage community membership directly or require approval; bulk-add or remove members as needed.

## Conversations & Messaging

- **Conversations**: Create new conversation threads (group or one-on-one), name channels, and add participants.
- **Messages**: Compose and edit rich-text messages (attachments supported) that update in real time via WebSockets.
- **Notifications**: Configure in-app toast and persistent alerts, as well as email digests for unread messages and mentions.
