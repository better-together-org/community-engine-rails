# Test-Driven Development: Stakeholder Acceptance Criteria

## Overview

This document defines stakeholder-focused acceptance criteria for implementing the Community & Social System features using Test-Driven Development (TDD). Each feature is broken down by stakeholder needs with specific, testable acceptance criteria.

## Stakeholder Roles

### Primary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Community members who need safety tools and social features
- **Community Organizers**: Elected leaders who need moderation and member management tools  
- **Platform Organizers**: Elected staff who manage comprehensive platform operations and host community/platform
- **Content Moderators**: Community volunteers who review reports and manage platform safety

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Technical team implementing and maintaining the features
- **Support Staff**: Team helping users with platform issues
- **Legal/Compliance**: Team ensuring platform meets safety and privacy regulations

## TDD Implementation Process

### Step-by-Step TDD Workflow

1. **Select Acceptance Criteria**: Choose one specific acceptance criteria to implement
2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create comprehensive tests that validate the acceptance criteria
3. **Run Tests**: Confirm tests fail appropriately (red)
4. **Write Minimum Code**: Implement just enough code to make tests pass
5. **Run Tests**: Confirm tests now pass (green)
6. **Refactor**: Clean up code while maintaining test passing status
7. **Repeat**: Move to next acceptance criteria

### Test Coverage Requirements

#### Model Tests
- Validations match acceptance criteria requirements
- Associations support user workflows
- Business logic methods implement stakeholder needs
- Security constraints prevent unauthorized actions

#### Controller Tests  
- Actions support stakeholder workflows
- Authorization enforces stakeholder permissions
- Parameters handle stakeholder input requirements
- Responses meet stakeholder interface needs

#### Feature Tests
- End-to-end workflows validate stakeholder journeys
- UI elements support stakeholder tasks
- Error handling meets stakeholder expectations
- Performance meets stakeholder response time needs

### Stakeholder Validation Process

#### After Each Feature Implementation
1. **Stakeholder Demo**: Show working feature to relevant stakeholders
2. **Acceptance Review**: Validate all acceptance criteria are met
3. **Feedback Collection**: Gather stakeholder input on implementation
4. **Iteration Planning**: Plan improvements based on feedback

#### Quality Gates
- All acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Security scan passes without high-severity issues
- Performance benchmarks meet stakeholder requirements
- Accessibility standards meet stakeholder accessibility needs

## Testing Patterns by Stakeholder Need

### End User-Focused Tests
```ruby
# Feature tests that validate user experience
RSpec.feature 'User blocks another user' do
  scenario 'user successfully blocks another user from profile' do
    # Test AC-2.1: I can block users from their profile page
  end
end
```

### Organizer/Moderator-Focused Tests
```ruby
# Controller tests that validate organizational capabilities
RSpec.describe BetterTogether::ReportsController do
  context 'when platform organizer reviews reports' do
    # Test AC-1.10: I can filter reports by category, status, and date range
  end
end
```

### System Integration Tests
```ruby
# Integration tests that validate cross-stakeholder workflows
RSpec.describe 'Report processing workflow' do
  scenario 'complete report lifecycle from submission to resolution' do
    # Test end-user report submission through organizer resolution
  end
end
```

This TDD approach ensures every feature serves clear stakeholder needs with measurable, testable acceptance criteria before any code is written.
