# Block Management Interface - TDD Acceptance Criteria

## Overview

This document defines stakeholder-focused acceptance criteria for implementing the Block Management Interface using Test-Driven Development (TDD). This feature enables users to manage their blocked users list with a comprehensive interface.

## Stakeholder Roles

### Primary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Community members who need to manage their blocked users for safety
- **Community Organizers**: Leaders who need to understand blocking patterns in their communities  
- **Platform Organizers**: Staff who need platform-wide blocking oversight

## Feature: Block Management Interface

### End User Acceptance Criteria
**As an end user, I want to manage my blocked users so that I can control my social experience.**

#### Core Blocking Functionality
- [ ] **AC-2.1**: I can block users from their profile page
- [ ] **AC-2.2**: I can block users from any of their content  
- [ ] **AC-2.3**: I can view a list of users I have blocked
- [ ] **AC-2.4**: I can unblock users from my block list
- [ ] **AC-2.5**: Blocked users cannot send me messages or interact with my content
- [ ] **AC-2.6**: I cannot see content from blocked users in feeds
- [ ] **AC-2.7**: I cannot block platform administrators
- [ ] **AC-2.8**: I cannot block myself
- [ ] **AC-2.9**: I receive confirmation when blocking/unblocking users

#### Block Management Interface
- [ ] **AC-2.10**: I can access my blocked users list from my account settings
- [ ] **AC-2.11**: I can search through my blocked users by name
- [ ] **AC-2.12**: I can see when I blocked each user
- [ ] **AC-2.13**: I can block a user by entering their username or email
- [ ] **AC-2.14**: I can quickly unblock users with a confirmation dialog
- [ ] **AC-2.15**: I can see how many users I have blocked
- [ ] **AC-2.16**: The interface works on mobile devices
- [ ] **AC-2.17**: The interface is accessible (WCAG AA compliant)

### Community Organizer Acceptance Criteria
**As a community organizer, I want to understand blocking patterns so that I can identify problem users.**

- [ ] **AC-2.18**: I can view users who have been blocked frequently in my community
- [ ] **AC-2.19**: I can see blocking trends in my community dashboard
- [ ] **AC-2.20**: I can intervene appropriately when blocking patterns indicate problems

### Platform Organizer Acceptance Criteria  
**As a platform organizer, I want comprehensive blocking controls so that I can manage platform-wide safety.**

- [ ] **AC-2.21**: I can view all blocking relationships across the platform
- [ ] **AC-2.22**: I can remove blocks when necessary (for investigations)
- [ ] **AC-2.23**: I can prevent specific users from being blocked (staff protection)

## TDD Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Block Management UI (End Users)
**Target Acceptance Criteria: AC-2.3, AC-2.4, AC-2.9 to AC-2.17**

#### Test Categories

**Model Tests** (PersonBlock model enhancements)
```ruby
# Test existing validations work with new interface
# Test search and filtering scopes
# Test blocking statistics and counts
```

**Controller Tests** (PersonBlocksController enhancements)
```ruby  
# Test index action with search and filtering
# Test new action for blocking by username/email
# Test destroy action with proper confirmations
# Test AJAX responses for interactive features
```

**Feature Tests** (End-to-end user workflows)
```ruby
# Test complete blocking workflow from profile
# Test block management dashboard functionality
# Test search and filtering features
# Test mobile responsiveness
# Test accessibility compliance
```

**JavaScript Tests** (Stimulus controllers)
```ruby
# Test block/unblock confirmation dialogs
# Test search functionality
# Test dynamic UI updates
```

### Phase 2: Administrative Features (Community/Platform Organizers)
**Target Acceptance Criteria: AC-2.18 to AC-2.23**

#### Test Categories

**Analytics Tests**
```ruby
# Test blocking pattern analysis
# Test community-specific blocking statistics
# Test platform-wide blocking oversight
```

**Administrative Interface Tests**  
```ruby
# Test community organizer blocking insights
# Test platform organizer blocking management
# Test intervention and override capabilities
```

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Users can complete block management tasks in under 30 seconds
- [ ] Block/unblock actions provide immediate visual feedback
- [ ] Interface passes WCAG AA accessibility audit
- [ ] Mobile interface maintains full functionality

### Safety Metrics
- [ ] Zero unauthorized blocks created (security validation)
- [ ] Platform administrators cannot be blocked (safety validation)
- [ ] Self-blocking attempts are prevented (validation working)

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Block list loads in under 2 seconds for 1000+ blocked users
- [ ] Search results appear in under 500ms
- [ ] AJAX updates complete without page refresh

## Implementation Sequence

### Step 1: Enhance Existing Controller (AC-2.3, AC-2.4)
1. Add search and filtering to PersonBlocksController#index
2. Enhance PersonBlocksController#destroy with confirmations
3. Add AJAX support for dynamic updates

### Step 2: Create User Interface Views (AC-2.10 to AC-2.17)
1. Create blocked users dashboard (person_blocks/index.html.erb)
2. Create block user form (person_blocks/new.html.erb)
3. Create interactive components (_blocked_person.html.erb)
4. Add mobile-responsive styling and accessibility features

### Step 3: Add JavaScript Interactivity (AC-2.9, AC-2.14)
1. Create Stimulus controller for block management
2. Add confirmation dialogs for unblocking
3. Implement search and filtering features
4. Add dynamic UI updates

### Step 4: Administrative Features (Phase 2)
1. Add community organizer blocking insights
2. Add platform organizer blocking management
3. Implement blocking pattern analysis

This TDD approach ensures every feature serves clear stakeholder needs with measurable, testable acceptance criteria before any code is written.
