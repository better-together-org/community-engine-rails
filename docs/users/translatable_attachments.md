## What are localized images and files (for users)

On this site, some images and files are language-specific. That means when you
view the site in a particular language, you'll see images and documents that
match that language.

How it works for you
--------------------

- When you switch the site language, some pictures or downloadable files may
  change to better match your language.
- If a language-specific file isn't available, the site may show the default
  language's file instead.

Why this helps
--------------

- Localized images improve clarity and accessibility (e.g., images containing
  text or culturally-specific illustrations).

If something looks wrong
-----------------------

- If an image appears in the wrong language, please report it using the site
  feedback form and include the page URL and which language you were viewing.
