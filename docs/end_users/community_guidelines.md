# Community Guidelines (End User Summary)

**Purpose:** Outline expected behavior to keep communities safe and respectful.

## Core Expectations
- Be respectful: no harassment, hate speech, or abusive content.
- Stay relevant: keep exchanges and posts on-topic for the community.
- Protect privacy: do not share others’ personal information without consent.
- Follow platform terms and local laws.

## Reporting and Moderation
- Use in-app reporting tools to flag inappropriate content or behavior.
- Community organizers and moderators review reports and may take action (warnings, suspensions, bans).

## Best Practices
- Assume good intent but set boundaries.
- Use clear titles and descriptions for offers/requests.
- Move sensitive details to private channels when appropriate.
- Ask moderators for guidance when unsure.
