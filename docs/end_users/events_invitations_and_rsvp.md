# Event Invitations and RSVP (End Users)

This guide explains how to view and respond to event invitations, how RSVP works, and what to expect on private platforms.

## Receiving Invitations

- You may be invited to an event either as a member (in-app notification + optional email) or via email (external address).
- Invitation links include a secure token that lets you review the event details and respond.
- If you aren’t signed in, you’ll be redirected to sign in or register; your invitation is saved so you can continue after authentication.

## Reviewing Invitations

- Invitation review page: shows event name, description, and your invitation status.
- Private platforms: your invitation link grants access to the specific event page even if the rest of the platform is private.
- Language: the invitation is localized to the language selected by the inviter; your session will switch to that language on first visit.

## Responding to Invitations

- Accept: you’ll be added as “Going”. If needed, you’ll be added to the host community automatically.
- Decline: marks the invitation declined; you can still view public details of the event if available.
- After accepting, your RSVP will appear as “Going” and a calendar entry will be added to your personal calendar.

## RSVP Controls on Event Pages

- Interested: marks your interest without committing to attend.
- Going: confirms attendance; creates a calendar entry.
- Cancel: removes your attendance record and deletes the related calendar entry.
- RSVP is available only after the event is scheduled (has a start time).

## ICS Calendar Export

- Event pages offer a “.ics” export (Add to Calendar) once scheduled.
- If you RSVP “Going”, your personal calendar also gets a calendar entry automatically.

## Privacy and Access

- Invitation tokens are limited to the specific event; they don’t grant access beyond it.
- If your token is expired or invalid, you’ll be asked to sign in or may see a not found page.

## Troubleshooting

- Link not working: check if the invitation has expired or was already accepted/declined.
- Can’t RSVP: the event might still be a draft (no start time). Try again once it’s scheduled.
- No calendar entry: only “Going” creates an entry; “Interested” does not. Make sure you have a primary calendar set up.
- Wrong account: if the invitation is for a specific member account, log in with that account to accept.
