# What’s New: Security & Privacy Updates (Aug 2025)

These changes improve privacy, safety, and trust while keeping the experience familiar.

- Invitation access expiry: If your platform requires invitations, the invitation link/code now stays valid for 30 minutes after first use in your session. After that, you’ll need to open a fresh invitation link. This protects against unintended sharing of access over long periods.
- Safer rich content: Custom page blocks (HTML/CSS) are now sanitized when rendered. Visual output should look the same; scripts and unsafe CSS are blocked for your safety.
- Safer share actions: Social share tracking only happens for allowed content types (pages, posts, events, communities). This reduces accidental or malicious tracking.
- Stronger privacy headers: The platform adds stronger browser security rules (Content Security Policy and related headers) to protect from malicious third‑party content.

No action is required on your part. If you see unexpected access prompts after long idle periods, simply revisit your invitation link or log in as usual.
