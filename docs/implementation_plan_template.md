### Overview
[Detailed description of what this feature does and why it's important]

### Stakeholder Acceptance Criteria
[Reference to TDD acceptance criteria document or list key acceptance criteria here]

### Models Required/Enhanced

```ruby
# [New or Enhanced Model Name]
class [ModelName] < ApplicationRecord
  # Follow string enum pattern (full words, ~7 chars average)
  enum status: { 
    [key1]: "[value1]", 
    [key2]: "[value2]" 
  }
  
  # Associations following cooperative patterns
  belongs_to :person, class_name: 'BetterTogether::Person'
  
  # Validations
  validates :field_name, presence: true
  
  # Scopes for common queries
  scope :scope_name, -> { where(condition) }
end
```

### Controllers Required/Enhanced

```ruby
# BetterTogether::[ControllerName] (no admin namespaces)
class BetterTogether::[ControllerName] < ApplicationController
  # Authorization through Pundit policies
  after_action :verify_authorized
  
  def index    # [Description]
  def show     # [Description]
  def create   # [Description]
  def update   # [Description]
  def destroy  # [Description]
  # Custom actions as needed
end
```

### Authorization & Permissions

```ruby
# Policy class for authorization
class [ModelName]Policy < ApplicationPolicy
  # Host community role-based permissions
  def index?
    # Logic for who can view lists
  end
  
  def show?
    # Logic for who can view individual records
  end
  
  def create?
    # Logic for who can create
  end
  
  # Context-sensitive permissions based on decision autonomy
  def moderate?
    # Different levels based on severity and granted autonomy
  end
end
```

### Views Required
- `better_together/[controller_name]/[view].html.erb` - [Description]
- `better_together/[controller_name]/_[partial].html.erb` - [Component description]

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Separate organizer dashboard areas for complex management tasks
- Context-sensitive controls that appear based on permissions
- Cooperative/democratic language in all interface text
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)
- Mobile-responsive design

### JavaScript/Stimulus Controllers

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/[feature_name]_controller.js
// [Description of interactive behaviors]
```

### Database Migration

```ruby
class [MigrationName] < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    # Use create_bt_table for standardized table creation
    create_bt_table :[table_name] do |t|
      # Use bt_* column helpers for consistency
      t.bt_references :[association_name], target_table: :better_together_[target_table], null: false
      t.bt_references :[polymorphic_name], polymorphic: true, null: false
      t.bt_identifier # For translated/identifiable records
      t.bt_privacy     # For privacy-enabled records
      
      # String enums following full-word pattern
      t.string :status, default: "[default_value]", null: false
      t.text :reason, null: false
      t.datetime :resolved_at
      
      # Proper indexing for performance
      t.index :status
      t.index :created_at
      t.index [:association_id, :status] # Composite indexes as needed
    end
    
    # For membership tables, use create_bt_membership_table
    # create_bt_membership_table :person_community_memberships, 
    #                           member_type: :person, 
    #                           joinable_type: :community
  end
end
```

**Migration Helper Benefits:**
- **Consistent structure**: `create_bt_table` provides UUID primary keys, lock_version, timestamps
- **Automatic naming**: Tables prefixed with `better_together_` automatically
- **Standardized columns**: `bt_*` helpers ensure consistency across the engine
- **Proper relationships**: `bt_references` creates UUID foreign keys with constraints
- **Optimistic locking**: `lock_version` included by default for concurrent access safety

### Key Features
- [Feature 1 description]
- [Feature 2 description]
- Integration with existing cooperative patterns
- Support for individual/consensus/community input decision-making as appropriate

### Testing Requirements (TDD Approach)

#### Stakeholder Acceptance Tests
```ruby
# Feature tests validating stakeholder acceptance criteria
RSpec.feature '[Feature Name]' do
  scenario '[acceptance criterion description]' do
    # Test implementation
  end
end
```

#### Model Tests
```ruby
RSpec.describe [ModelName] do
  # Test validations, associations, scopes, business logic
  # Use FactoryBot factories with realistic Faker data
end
```

#### Controller Tests
```ruby
RSpec.describe BetterTogether::[ControllerName] do
  # Test all actions, authorization, parameter handling
  # Test context-sensitive permissions
end
```

#### Policy Tests
```ruby
RSpec.describe [ModelName]Policy do
  # Test host community role-based authorization
  # Test context-sensitive permission logic
end
```

## Collaborative Decision Framework

### Individual Organizer Autonomy
[What decisions can individual platform organizers make independently?]

### Consensus Required  
[What decisions require agreement from multiple organizers?]

### Community Input Required

- User ownership verification for personal data
- Context-sensitive permissions based on granted autonomy
- Audit trails for all significant actions
