# Matching & Notifications

Joatu helps connect Offers and Requests automatically. When there’s a likely match, both sides can be notified.

## What You’ll See

- On the Offer/Request pages: a list of possible matches (for the creator).
- On the Hub: the 5 most recent Offers and Requests.
- Notifications: little alerts that tell you “there’s a match” or “an agreement changed status”.

## Marking Notifications as Read

- When you open the related Offer/Request/Agreement page, any matching notifications are marked as “read” for you.
- This keeps your notification list tidy.

### Matching

- We compare categories and target details between Offers and Requests.
- Offers find Requests and vice‑versa — both directions are supported.
- Matches exclude the same creator (you won’t be matched with your own listing).

### Notifications

- Match notifications include both the Offer and the Request so either side can be notified.
- Agreement notifications link you directly to the Agreement page.
- When you view an Offer/Request/Agreement, any related notifications are marked as read for your account.

### Search & Filters

- Search looks at:
  - The title (translated under the hood),
  - The description (rich text), and
  - Category names.
- Filters let you narrow by category, status, and sort order.
