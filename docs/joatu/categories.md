# Categories

Categories are simple labels that help Offers and Requests find each other.

- Pick the category that best describes your Offer or Request.
- You can pick more than one if it helps.

## Why Categories Matter

- They make search and matching smarter.
- They help people browse topics they care about.

<summary>Bonus: How Categories work behind the scenes</summary>

- Categories are translated (multi‑language support).
- Each Offer/Request links to Categories through a small “join” record.
- Matching uses category overlap as a main signal.
- Admins can manage the category list in the platform’s Host area.
