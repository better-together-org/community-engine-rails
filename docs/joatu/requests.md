# Requests

Requests are things people need help with — like “Need a ladder,” “Looking for translation help,” or “Need a ride to the clinic.”

- Easy idea: You post what you need, so people who can help can find you.
- Categories help your Request appear in matching results.

## How to Create a Request

1. Go to Requests and select “New Request”.
2. Give it a clear name (e.g., “Borrow a 10ft ladder”).
3. Add a short description (when you need it, any details that help).
4. Choose one or more categories (this helps matching).
5. Save.

You’ll see matches (Offers that fit your categories), and you may receive a notification when there’s a good fit.
