# Joatu Exchange: Simple Guide

This guide explains the Joatu exchange in clear language. It covers Offers, Requests, Agreements, and Categories — plus how matching and notifications work.

Use the quick sections to get what you need. For curious readers, each page includes bonus details you can expand.

- What is Joatu? It’s a simple way for people to offer help or ask for help, match up, and confirm an agreement to get things done.
- Who is it for? Community members and organizers who want an easy way to share skills, tools, and time.

## Core Pieces

- Offers: Things people are willing to do or share.
- Requests: Things people need help with.
- Agreements: The “handshake” connecting one Offer to one Request.
- Categories: Topics that help Offers and Requests find each other.
