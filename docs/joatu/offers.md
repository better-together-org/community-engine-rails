# Offers

Offers are things people are willing to do or share — like “Bike repair,” “Lend a ladder,” or “Help with childcare forms.”

- Easy idea: You post what you can offer, in your own words.
- People who need it can find you by category or keywords.

## How to Create an Offer

1. Go to Offers and select “New Offer”.
2. Give it a clear name (e.g., “Basic bike repair”).
3. Add a short description (what you can do, when you’re available).
4. Choose one or more categories (this helps matching).
5. Save.

You’ll see matches (Requests that fit your categories), and you may receive a notification when there’s a good fit.
