**HIGH PRIORITY (Next Month):**
- 🔄 Event & Calendar System - Consolidate partial assessments
- ❌ Metrics & Analytics System - Performance monitoring
- ❌ Notification System - Cross-cutting communication
- ❌ Geography & Location System - Spatial data foundation

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Quarter):**
- ❌ Navigation System
- ❌ Content Organization System
- ❌ Contact Management System

**LOWER PRIORITY:**
