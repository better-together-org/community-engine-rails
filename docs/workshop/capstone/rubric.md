# Capstone Rubric

Each team’s capstone is scored across criteria that reflect project standards.

## Scoring (0–4 each; total 32)
- Requirements (AC): clear acceptance criteria, realistic scope
- Tests: request-first approach; coverage of critical paths; readable
- Code Quality: follows conventions, string enums, concerns; minimal complexity
- Internationalization: all user-facing strings localized; i18n health passes
- Security: Brakeman/bundler-audit clean; safe patterns (no unsafe constantization)
- Operations: deploy plan documented; env/secrets noted; migration plan if applicable
- Observability: Sidekiq/notifications logs visible; error handling reasonable
- Demo: coherent narrative; shows end-to-end behavior; answers Q&A clearly

## Guidance
- Favor smaller, well‑tested scope over under‑tested ambition
- Include performance and access control considerations if relevant
- Provide a short “risks & follow‑ups” section for realism
