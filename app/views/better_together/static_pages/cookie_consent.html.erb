      <h2 id="what-are-cookies">1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
      
      <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
      
      <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, <%= host_platform.name %>) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., analytics, error tracking). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>

      <h2 id="why-we-use-cookies">2. Why We Use Cookies</h2>
      
      <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our platform to operate (we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies). Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our platform, provide error tracking, and analyze platform usage. These are "optional" cookies.</p>

      <h2 id="types-of-cookies">3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

      <h3>First-Party Cookies (Always Active)</h3>
      <p>These are cookies that we set ourselves. We use these cookies to provide our core services and functionality.</p>

      <h3>Third-Party Cookies (Optional)</h3>
      <p>These are cookies set by external service providers. We only use third-party cookies when explicitly configured by platform organizers and with your consent where required by law.</p>

      <h2 id="essential-cookies">4. Essential Cookies</h2>
      
      <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our platform and to use some of its features. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the platform, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our platform functions. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings as described below under "Your Choices Regarding Cookies."</p>

      <h3>Session Storage</h3>

      <h2 id="optional-cookies">5. Optional Cookies</h2>

      <p>These cookies are only used when explicitly enabled by platform organizers and, where required by law, with your consent.</p>

      <h3>Analytics and Performance Cookies (If Enabled)</h3>
      <p>The platform includes built-in metrics functionality that tracks usage patterns <strong>without identifying individual users</strong>. This system is privacy-focused and does not use cookies or track personal data.</p>
      
      <p>Platform organizers may choose to enable third-party analytics services. If enabled, you will be notified and asked for consent where required by law.</p>

      <h3>Error Tracking Cookies (If Enabled)</h3>
      <p>When the platform organizer configures Sentry error tracking (via the SENTRY_CLIENT_KEY environment variable), error data may be collected to help diagnose and fix technical issues. This may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser information and device type</li>
        <li>Error messages and stack traces</li>
        <li>URL where the error occurred</li>
        <li>Approximate timestamp of the error</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sentry may use cookies to track error sessions. For more information, see <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="your-choices">6. Your Choices Regarding Cookies</h2>

      <p>For optional cookies (analytics, error tracking), you have the following choices:</p>
      <ul>
