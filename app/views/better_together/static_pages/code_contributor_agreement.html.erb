      <p><strong>"Material"</strong> means the work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties.

      <h2 id="grant-of-patent-license">3. Grant of Patent License</h2>
      
      <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.</p>
      
      <p>If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>

      <h2 id="outbound-license">4. Outbound License</h2>
      
      <p>Based on the grant of rights in Sections 2 and 3, if We include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission Date.</p>
      
      <p>The project is currently licensed under the <strong>GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)</strong>. We may change the project license in the future, and Your Contribution may be distributed under the new license.</p>

      <p>If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.</p>

      <h2 id="our-rights">6. Our Rights</h2>
      
      <p>You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.</p>
