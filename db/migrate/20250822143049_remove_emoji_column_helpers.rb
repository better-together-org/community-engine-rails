class RemoveEmojiColumnHelpers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]
  def change
    # This migration ensures any existing columns created with bt_emoji_text or bt_emoji_string
    # are compatible with standard Rails text/string column behavior.
    # Since this project uses PostgreSQL, the emoji helpers only added MySQL-specific
    # collation settings that don't apply to PostgreSQL, so no actual column changes needed.
    
    # If this were MySQL, we would need to change collation:
    # change_column :better_together_joatu_agreements, :terms, :text, collation: nil
    
    # For PostgreSQL, the columns are already standard text/string columns
    # No database changes required - this migration serves as documentation
  end
end
